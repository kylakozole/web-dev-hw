<p>My Literature Showcase choice was based off of the novel, the Secret Garden by Frances Burnett Hodgson.
<br />
I tried to stylize everything to give ooff a rose garden color and font choice. I did not nail down the sizing of everything.
<br />
I could not for the life of me figure out how to get my fixed heading/picture to be centered on the page... I really want to rsolve this issue. I thought my fixed element was super cool and i feel like there are a lot of posibilities with this learning section.
</p>
<p>CSS was really enjoyable to see personalized results, but it was very challengin to narrow down what elements to focus on learning. THe vast amount of new information also made deciphering errors that were breaking code exponentially more difficult to track down.
<br />
I learned to change one element at a time, even if it tedious to have to save your style sheet each time. I still didn't figure out all of my formatting glitches.
