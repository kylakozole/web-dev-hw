			     <h1>RWD: Reponsive Web Design</h1>
	          <p><b><i>Why do we need it?</b></i> "Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design which makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.
            <br />
            Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. Therefore, Google announced Mobilegeddon in 2015, and started to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device. Responsive web design is an example of user interface plasticity."

      <h4>
        How wireframes play a role in RWD?
      </h4>
      <p> "Wireframing for mobile devices first (or from narrow widths outwards)
        helps us prioritize site elements while putting us in a good mindset for
        thinking about what content is most relevant to the site visitor and how
         your content becomes available to work with on wider screens."

			<h4>How is flexbox suitable, or not, for RWD?
			</h4>
			<p>FlexBox is super important for RWD because it provides direction for how elements need to be organized as the page adapts to various size screens.
      <br /> This is an essential component for keeping information ordered in an intentional manner. </p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h4>
        Describe your process (or what you think you process will be) for RWD?
      </h4>
        <p>My process will entail just figuring out how all of this works...
        <br /> I'll start with sketching my prioritized info where it will be centrally focused on the smallest screen, mobile. I'll continue to then adapt it into larger screens, knowing that more elements can be seen on a larger screen.
        <br /> Then I'll hope for the best & wish myself good luck getting it done.
        <br /> I think it will take a bit of back and forth adjustments with different userfaces.</p>
