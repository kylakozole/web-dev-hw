# My First README.md

## Kyla Kozole
*web-dev-hw GitHub-02 Assignment*

**My experiences:**

 - The process of getting everything set up and figuring out what I'm to do assignments on is very overwhelming.
 - I hope this course will not continue to be so ridiculously time consuming simply because it's confusing.

**My Goals**
 1. Deep Breath.
 2. Get ahead with assignments so I can be a part of the community, not just responsive.
 3. Do yoga when this document deletes itself for the 3rd time
   - learn why I messed up and wasted *so* much time.
 4. Know that this can only get better...

 `**I get why all the coding instructions are in code boxes, they do not apply formatting**`
