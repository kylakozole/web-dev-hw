      "I keep saying to myself,
      `What is it? What is it?’
      It’s something. It can’t be nothing!
      I don’t know its name so I call it Magic.
      I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and
      from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.

      Something pushes it up and draws it.
      Sometimes since I’ve been in the garden
      I’ve looked up through the trees at the sky and
      I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if
      something were pushing and drawing in my chest and
      making me breathe fast.

      Magic is always pushing and drawing and
      making things out of nothing.
      Everything is made out of Magic,
      leaves and trees,
      flowers and birds,
      badgers and
      foxes and
      squirrels and
      people.

      So it must be all around us."

      ― Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Secret Garden
