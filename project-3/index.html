        <h2>The Secret Garden</h2>
        <p><center>Written by Fances Hodgson Burnett</center></p>

        <h4>Brief Summary/ Intoduction:</h4>
        <p>"The orphaned Mary Lennox is sullen, ill tempered, and unloved when she’s
  sent to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven. A man consumed by grief over
  the death of his wife, Archibald has allowed his sprawling estate on the moors
  to fall into grim disrepair. It’s when Mary begins tending to her late aunt’s
  mysterious garden—locked up and neglected for years—that she discovers its
  life-changing secrets and a flowering rejuvenation of the human spirit.

Out of this dark, closed-off world and a child’s innate curiosity about life and
death comes one of the most transformative coming-of-age novels ever written."

<h4>Reviews:</h4>
<p><i>"<b>Yorshire Pudding</b>- I read this book because, although I heard of it
  since childhood, I never read it. It is extremely dated, lacks character
  development, and offers an extremely predictable conclusion. I found it
  difficult to stay with the Yorkshire Dialect. It would have been more enjoyable
  it I read it as a parody. The most disappointing thing about the book is that
  you never learn the fate of the main character. It's like the author had five
  minutes to finish her manuscript, so she left the fate of the main character
  open. Perhaps there is a sequel, although I have no desire to read it if it
  exists."</i> -Phyllis Heller</p>

<p><i>"<b>Worst Book Ever</b>- It was very boring. It had no adventure and it
  made no sense to me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."</i> -Mike</p>

<p><i>"<b>Soul is Smiling</b>- My favorite feel wonderful book of all time. I
  love the story. I can smell the damp spring earth in the garden and I delight
  in the love of growing things. It is a story of hope. It is a story of how the
  human spirit searches for something to help it thrive and when it is found how
  it drinks it up and devours it fully, richly and completely. Everyone should
  read this book, children and adults alike. It will make your soul smile. You
  will want to read it over again many times throughout your life."</i>
