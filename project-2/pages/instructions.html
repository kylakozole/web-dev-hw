    <h1>Let's Get Started!</h1>
    <h4>Prep:</h4>
      <p> Get yourself set-up with all your supplies accessible (palette not shown).</p>
      <p><i><b>Warning:</b></i> Oil paint somehow manages to get on everything. Cover anything you don't want painted (ie. your carpet) with plastic sheet. Even with an apron, you may still get it on your clothes... good luck getting it out.</p>

    <h4>Step 1:</h4>
      <p>Paint your blank canvas with 2 layers of Gesso (allow time to dry between layers).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Use sand paper to smooth each layer out if your don't want any texture to start.</i></li>
        </ul>
      <br/>

        <figcaption>This is a poor quality canvas, made poorer by a dog jumping on top of it in the car. BUT it's cheap and fine to start out with </br>

    <p>What you need to know about <i>oil paint</i>:
      <ul>
        <li>Oil paint produces rich paintings with depth and range due to light reflecting off of many layers of paint. It travels through layers rather than reflecting off of the surface layer.</li>
        <li>This means we'll be working with lots of layers!</li>
        <li>Oil paint takes forever to dry, if you wants to continue blending/mixing layers, apply <dfn title="Referring to when paintings were done on plaster walls. Al fresco is when the pigments were applied to wet plaster, they dry bonded together. Al secco is applied on dry plaster, the pigment later flakes off with time."> al fresco. </dfn></li>
        <li>For clean, seperate layers, apply <dfn title="Referring to when paintings were done on plaster walls. Al fresco is when the pigments were applied to wet plaster, they dry bonded together. Al secco is applied on dry plaster, the pigment later flakes off with time."> al secco. </dfn></li>
      </ul>
  <hr>
  <h4>Step 2:</h4>
    <p>Choose a color to paint your canvas with! This base layer will affect the tone of your painting on top.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your Gamsol to thin this layer across your entire canvas.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I then like to layout my painting, finding the space for various elements in my composition (you can also map it out on your canvas <i>first</i> with charcoal)</p>

  <h4>Step 3:</h4>
    <p>Go at it! Start mixing and smearing that paint on the canvas. Use any tools you want to apply the paint, get creative!</p>

    <p><i>How do I know when I'm done?!</i> <br />
    This is a common artist's dillema... </p>
    <p>Here's my advice, ask yourself, "Have I done enough to effectively represent my subject(s)?" and "Have I conveyed my intended meaning?"</p>
    <p>If you answer "yes," then congrats! If you answer "no," then keep at it! OR just quit there, congrats you finished!</p>
