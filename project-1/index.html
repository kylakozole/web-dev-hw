      <p>"I keep saying to myself,<br />
      `What is it? What is it?’<br />
      It’s something. It can’t be nothing!<br />
      I don’t know its name so I call it Magic.<br />
<br />
      ...</p>
      <p> I’ve looked up through the trees at the sky and<br />
      I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if<br />
      something were pushing and drawing in my chest and<br />
      making me breathe fast.</p>

      <p> Magic is always pushing and drawing and<br />
      making things out of nothing."</p>
