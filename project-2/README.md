Project-2</h1>

<h4> Project Contents: </h4>
<p>We did a ton of modifying text with:
  <ul>
    <li> semantic markups</li>
    <li>lists</li>
    <li>formal head, body, and structure elements</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>My experience</h4>
<p>I'm interested in why there are so many alternatives for the same end format result.
<i><b>I'm assuming it's based on the type of web browsers or something similar?</b></i></p>
<p> I look forward to getting better at organizing my code. It gets difficult to keep track of closing code when you start nesting.
<i><b>Maybe there are mental check-lists that can make it easier?</b></i></p>

<p>I did have issues with getting my <abbr title="abbreviation">abbrev</abbr> to work on the <abbr title="black and white">"B&W"</abbr>... huh. Well that just worked. I'll go back and fix it.<br />
  <ul>
    <li><s> Fix index.html</s> Donezo.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>I read a lot of the issues board, but honestly, our class is quick to respond. By the time I checked them, they had all been addressed. Way to go @jonswallow. I'll be able to be active sooner on this next project process.</p>

<h4>Part 2:</h4>
<p>Still didn't help on the message board... I was behind myself.</p>
<p>What I had no problems with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>relative and absolute links</li>
    <li>various form elements</li>
    <li>styling</li>
    <li>tables</li>
  </ul>
<p>What I had problems with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>images</li>
      <li>image size</li>
      <li>form heading</li>
      <li>submit button with image</li>
      <li>formatting/organizing my code</li>
      <li>submitting on-time</li>
    </ul>
<p>I got sick this week and I learned that learning coding does not work when my head isn't functioning... So that sucked.<br />
<i>Next week will be better. </i></p>
